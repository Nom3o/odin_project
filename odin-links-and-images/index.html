Preparation

To get some practice using links and images throughout this lesson we need an HTML project to work with.

    Create a new directory named odin-links-and-images.
    Within that directory, create a new file named index.html.
    Open the file in VS Code and fill in the usual HTML boilerplate.
    Finally, add the following h1 to the body:

-->

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>Document</title>
</head>
<body>
    <h1>Homepage</h1>
    <img src="https://www.theodinproject.com/mstile-310x310.png" alt="odin image" height="300" width="300">
    <a href="about.html" target="_blank">About</a>
</body>
</html>
